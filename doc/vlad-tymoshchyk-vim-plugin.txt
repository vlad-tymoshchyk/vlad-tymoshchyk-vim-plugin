THIS IS DOCUMENTATION FOR MY PLUGIN

{fzf}{1} in itself is not a Vim plugin, and the official repository only
provides the {basic wrapper function}{2} for Vim and it's up to the users to
write their own Vim commands with it. However, I've learned that many users of
fzf are not familiar with Vimscript and are looking for the "default"
implementation of the features they can find in the alternative Vim plugins.

This repository is a bundle of fzf-based commands and mappings extracted from
my {.vimrc}{3} to address such needs. They are not designed to be flexible or
configurable, and there's no guarantee of backward-compatibility.
